The Knight Industries Three Thousand and one Automotive Computer System

This repository herein contains all custom made scripts and files that were created in the process of developing the KITT++ Automotive computer system for HWD101 at Seneca College in Toronto Ontario Canada â€“ Winter 2017
The main purpose of this git is to preserve the work we did on creating a custom GUI using the Qt Software suite as well as minimal documentation for the main software installed on the machine.
I will look into providing a full image of the OS we created as well as version of our design report once I have a chance to remove any personal information from it.

Thank you.
